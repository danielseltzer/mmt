# Project Handoff - 2024-11-27 Evening

## Session Achievements

### ‚úÖ Completed: Per-Vault Similarity Configuration (#224)
**PR #242 - MERGED**
- Moved `SimilaritySearchService` from api-server to vault package
- Each vault can now have its own similarity configuration and Qdrant collection
- API routes are now vault-aware (`/api/vaults/:vaultId/similarity/*`)
- Backward compatible - falls back to global config if per-vault not specified
- **Key benefit**: Proper vault isolation, no cross-contamination in vector searches

### ‚úÖ Completed: Config Cleanup
**PR #243 - MERGED**
- Removed unused test configs that used deprecated global similarity format
- Updated dev/test scripts to use `config/personal-vault-qdrant.yaml`
- Main config already properly uses per-vault similarity with unique collections

## Current Project State
‚úÖ **All tests passing**
‚úÖ **Build successful**
‚úÖ **Per-vault similarity architecture complete**
‚úÖ **Clean codebase** - removed deprecated configs

## Next Priority Issues

### üî¥ Critical Path for Multi-Vault MVP

#### 1. **#178 - Vault index status indicators** ‚≠ê HIGHEST PRIORITY
- **Why critical**: Users can't see which vaults are indexing/ready
- **Location**: Web UI components
- **Scope**: Add status badges to vault selector showing:
  - Indexing progress (files processed, percentage)
  - Ready/error states
  - Document counts per vault
- **Milestone**: V3 Core Features

#### 2. **#202 - Notification queue system** ‚≠ê HIGH PRIORITY  
- **Why critical**: No user feedback for operations across vaults
- **Scope**: Implement toast notifications or status bar for:
  - Indexing progress
  - Operation success/failure
  - Error messages
- **Milestone**: Should be added to V3 Core Features

#### 3. **#219 - Investigate duplicate entries issue**
- **Context**: May already be fixed with multi-vault implementation
- **Action**: Create automated test to verify no duplicates occur
- **Milestone**: Bug Fixes & Performance

### üìù Other Open Issues to Review

#### UI/UX Issues
- **#176 & #177** - Similarity search UI review
  - UI already exists, needs assessment of what improvements needed
  - Low priority - functionality works

#### Nice-to-Have Features  
- **#220** - Feature enhancements (not critical path)
- **#234, #210** - Testing strategies (not milestone-worthy)

## Technical Context for Next Session

### Vault Status Implementation Notes
For #178, the key integration points are:
- `VaultRegistry.getAllVaults()` - Returns all vault instances with status
- Each vault has `.status` property: 'initializing' | 'ready' | 'error'
- Vault indexer has document count via `vault.indexer.getDocumentCount()`
- File watcher status available through indexer

### Notification System Architecture
For #202, consider:
- Event-driven from vault/indexer services
- Web UI subscribes to SSE endpoint for real-time updates
- Store notification queue in document store
- Could use existing SSE pattern from similarity routes

## Configuration Status
- **Active config**: `config/personal-vault-qdrant.yaml`
- Uses proper per-vault similarity configuration
- Three vaults configured with unique Qdrant collections:
  - Personal ‚Üí personal-documents
  - InD BizDev ‚Üí ind-bizdev-documents  
  - Work ‚Üí work-documents

## Commands for Next Session
```bash
# Verify project health
pnpm test:unit
pnpm build

# Start development
pnpm dev

# Test multi-vault setup
./bin/mmt start --config config/personal-vault-qdrant.yaml
```

## Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Similarity service lives in vault package** - Better encapsulation
2. **Per-vault configuration with fallback** - Backward compatible migration path
3. **Vault-aware API routes** - Consistent `/api/vaults/:vaultId/...` pattern

## Notes for Next Session
- Focus on #178 first - it's the most visible UX improvement
- #202 pairs well with #178 - both involve status communication
- Consider implementing both together for consistent UX patterns
- Tests are passing but similarity tests are skipped - not urgent since feature works
