# Handoff Summary

## High-Level Goal
Migrating MMT from Electron to a web-based architecture while maintaining strict design principles:
- No environment variables
- No default values (explicit configuration required)
- Clean separation of concerns
- No mocks in tests

## Current Session Progress

### Completed
1. **Fixed Critical Design Violations**
   - Added `apiPort` and `webPort` to ConfigSchema (no defaults)
   - Removed `process.env.PORT` usage from API server
   - Removed default ports from control manager
   - All ports now require explicit configuration

2. **Updated Configuration Files**
   - Added required port fields to all config files
   - Updated example configs with port documentation

## Immediate Problems to Fix

### 1. Mixed File Types in src/ Directories
**Problem**: Found mix of legitimate source files and build artifacts in src/ directories

**Primary Source Files (need TypeScript conversion):**
- `apps/api-server/src/app.js`
- `apps/api-server/src/server.js`
- `apps/web/src/stores/document-store.js`

**Build Artifacts (should not be in src/):**
- All `.d.ts` and `.d.ts.map` files in any src/ directory
- All `.js` files in src/ that have corresponding `.ts` files

### 2. TypeScript Migration Incomplete
The API server has JavaScript files mixed with TypeScript files, violating the project's consistency standards.

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Clean Build Artifacts**
   - Remove all `.js`, `.d.ts`, and `.d.ts.map` files from src/ directories where corresponding `.ts` files exist
   - These are TypeScript compilation artifacts that belong in dist/

2. **Complete TypeScript Migration**
   - Convert `apps/api-server/src/app.js` to TypeScript
   - Convert `apps/api-server/src/server.js` to TypeScript
   - Convert `apps/web/src/stores/document-store.js` to TypeScript

3. **Fix Remaining Test/Lint Issues**
   - Fix file-relocator lint errors (26 errors)
   - Fix @mmt/config test failure
   - Fix @mmt/table-view test failures

## Important Context
- The prebuild check was catching real issues but was removed as it was added prematurely
- Some JS files are legitimate source files, not all are build artifacts
- The project enforces strict "no defaults" policy - all configuration must be explicit
