   - Vault state persisted in localStorage
   - API routes are vault-aware (`/api/vaults/:vaultId/...`)

2. **Document Management**
   - View documents with relative path display (e.g., "/" for root)
   - Filter by name, content, folders, tags, metadata, date, size
   - Sort by name, path, modified date, size (click to toggle asc/desc)
   - Export to CSV/JSON
   - Individual checkbox selection works correctly

3. **File Operations** 
   - Rename files (updates links automatically)
   - Move files (updates links automatically)
   - Delete files
   - All operations maintain referential integrity

4. **Search & Query**
   - Full-text search across documents
   - Natural language date filters (e.g., "last 30 days")
   - Complex filter combinations with AND/OR logic
   - Server-side filtering for performance

### 🔧 Configuration

The app requires a YAML configuration file. Example multi-vault setup:

```yaml
# config/multi-vault.yaml
vaults:
  - name: 'Personal'
    path: /Users/yourname/Notes/Personal
    fileWatching:
      enabled: true
      debounceMs: 500
      ignorePatterns:
        - '**/.git/**'
        - '**/.obsidian/**'
  
  - name: 'Work'
    path: /Users/yourname/Notes/Work
    fileWatching:
      enabled: true
      debounceMs: 500

  - name: 'Projects'
    path: /Users/yourname/Notes/Projects
    fileWatching:
      enabled: false

apiPort: 3001
webPort: 5173
```

### 📝 API Endpoints

#### Vault Management
- `GET /api/vaults` - List all configured vaults
- `GET /api/vaults/:vaultId/status` - Get vault status

#### Document Operations (Vault-Aware)
- `GET /api/vaults/:vaultId/documents` - List documents
- `GET /api/vaults/:vaultId/documents/by-path/*` - Get document by path
- `POST /api/vaults/:vaultId/operations/rename` - Rename document
- `POST /api/vaults/:vaultId/operations/move` - Move document
- `POST /api/vaults/:vaultId/operations/delete` - Delete document
- `POST /api/vaults/:vaultId/export` - Export documents

### 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

1. **YAML Parsing Errors**: Some markdown files with invalid frontmatter cause parsing errors
   - Non-breaking, just logged to console
   - Common in files with template variables like `{{DATE}}`

2. **Performance**: Large vaults (5000+ files) take 1-2 seconds to index initially
   - Subsequent loads use cache for faster startup

3. **No Hot Reload**: File changes update index but don't refresh UI automatically
   - Manual refresh required to see changes

4. **Limited Export**: Export only includes metadata, not full content

5. **No Similarity Search**: Infrastructure exists but not integrated (#155)

### 🎯 Next Development Areas

#### Immediate Priorities
1. **Auto-refresh UI** when file changes detected
2. **Fix YAML parsing** - handle template variables gracefully
3. **Performance optimization** for large vaults
4. **Search improvements** - highlight matches, relevance ranking

#### V3 Remaining Work
- Issue #158: Per-tab vault state (frontend work)
- Issue #157: Tab bar component for vault switching
- Issue #162: Vault-specific settings

#### Future Features
1. **Similarity search** using embeddings (#155)
2. **Saved views** - persist filter/sort configurations
3. **Bulk operations** - apply operations to multiple files
4. **Content preview** in table or sidebar
5. **Plugin system** for custom operations

### 💡 Development Tips

1. **No Mocks Policy**: Always test with real files in temp directories
2. **Schema-First**: All data contracts defined in `@mmt/entities`
3. **TDD Approach**: Write tests first, especially for bug fixes
4. **Explicit Config**: No defaults, always require --config flag
5. **Clean Commits**: Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)

### 🔍 Debugging

Enable debug logging:
```bash
DEBUG=mmt:* ./bin/mmt start --config config/multi-vault.yaml
```

Check vault status:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/vaults | jq
```

Test vault-specific documents:
```bash
# List documents from a specific vault
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/vaults/Personal/documents?limit=5" | jq

# Check fullPath is included (for unique row IDs)
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/vaults/Personal/documents?limit=1" | jq '.documents[0].fullPath'
```

   - Added synchronization between external and internal sort state
   - Bidirectional sorting works on all columns
   - Disabled sorting on checkbox column

4. **Checkbox Selection Fix**
   - Added `fullPath` field to API response
   - Changed table row ID from `path` to `fullPath`
   - Each document now has unique identifier

### 🔄 Recent Changes (2025-08-13 Session - Part 2)

#### GitHub Issue Reorganization
- Closed 51 → 47 open issues (4 completed/obsolete closed)
- Created 5 new focused milestones:
  - Bug Fixes & Performance (6 issues)
  - Tech Debt & Infrastructure (7 issues)  
  - Documentation & Developer Experience (4 issues)
  - Future Enhancements (8 issues)
  - V3 Core Features (25 issues)
- Closed 10 legacy milestones

#### Bug Fixes Completed
1. **#152 (P0)**: Web server not starting with control manager - FIXED
   - Updated `waitForWebReady` to properly check port availability
   - Added better diagnostics and initialization delays

2. **#86 (P1)**: Flaky file watcher test - FIXED
   - Added initialization delay for file watcher
   - Increased timeouts and polling frequency
   - Tests now pass consistently (10/10 runs)

3. **#138/#122**: Table-view tests - CLOSED as intentional
   - Tests explicitly skipped during rapid UI development
   - Component working correctly in production

4. **#141 (P1)**: Integration test architecture - PARTIALLY FIXED
   - Fixed config format to use new `vaults` array
   - Updated test setup to start BOTH API and web servers
   - Tests now run against real full stack (API on 3001, Web on 3002)
   - Architecture now consistent between dev and test

### ⚠️ Integration Tests - Remaining Work

**Current Status**: 
- Infrastructure is correct - both servers start properly
- Architecture is consistent - no environment variable hacks
- But tests still fail because they're using happy-dom instead of real browser

**Root Problem**:
The integration tests are trying to render React components in happy-dom and make API calls, but happy-dom doesn't actually load the web server's pages. The tests need to be rewritten to use a real browser.

**Next Steps to Complete #141**:
1. **Option A: Convert to E2E tests with Playwright**
   ```bash
   pnpm add -D @playwright/test
   ```
   - Rewrite integration tests to use Playwright
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3002` 
   - Test through real browser automation
   - This is the correct approach for integration testing

2. **Option B: Keep component tests separate**
   - Move current tests to unit tests (without API calls)
   - Mock the fetch calls (violates NO MOCKS policy though)
   - Create separate E2E tests for full stack

**Recommended Approach**: Option A - Use Playwright for true integration tests

Example test structure needed:
```typescript
// tests/integration/document-table.test.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('displays documents from vault', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3002');
  await page.waitForSelector('[data-testid="document-table"]');
  // ... rest of test
});
```
