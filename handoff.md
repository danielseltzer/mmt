## Completed Work âœ…

### 1. NO MOCKS Policy Violations (Priority 1) - COMPLETED âœ…
**Status**: All 4 violations fixed
**Commit**: `cd053a2` - "fix: remove NO MOCKS policy violations in tests"

**Fixed Files**:
- `apps/api-server/tests/unit/reveal-in-finder.test.ts` - Replaced mocked child_process with real VaultRegistry
- `apps/api-server/tests/unit/similarity-status.test.ts` - Created TestSimilarityService class instead of vi.fn() mocks
- `apps/web/src/__tests__/sorting.test.tsx` - Used real zustand store instead of mocked store
- `packages/vault/src/__tests__/registry.test.ts` - Removed console.log mocking, test actual behavior

**Impact**: Tests now use real implementations, improving reliability and catching actual integration issues.

### 2. Console.log Usage (Priority 2) - COMPLETED âœ… 
**Status**: All production code console statements replaced
**Commits**: 
- `f534146` - "fix: replace remaining console statements with Logger module in production code"
- `ef6600b` - "fix: replace console.log with Logger module in web components and control manager"
- `016ecc8` - "fix: replace console.log with Logger module (partial)"

**Fixed Files**:

#### Session 1 (5 files):
- `packages/scripting/tests/test-api-server.ts` - Debug logging â†’ logger.debug()
- `packages/scripting/tests/result-formatter.test.ts` - Debug output â†’ logger.debug()
- `packages/indexer/tests/indexer.test.ts` - Performance logging â†’ logger.info()
- `tools/generate-operations-report.ts` - Report generation â†’ logger.info()
- `tools/control-manager/src/docker-manager.ts` - Docker operations â†’ logger.info() (partial)

#### Session 2 (10 files):
**Web Components (8 files)**:
- `apps/web/src/components/FilterBar.jsx` - Error/warn logging for config and filters
- `apps/web/src/components/PreviewModal.jsx` - Error logging for preview/execution
- `apps/web/src/components/PipelinePanels.jsx` - Info logging for pipeline execution
- `apps/web/src/components/OutputPanel.jsx` - Info logging for user actions
- `apps/web/src/components/SimilarityStatusIndicator.jsx` - Error logging for status
- `apps/web/src/components/DocumentTable.tsx` - Debug logging for selections
- `apps/web/src/stores/document-store.ts` - Error logging for storage operations
- `packages/table-view/src/TableView.tsx` - Debug logging for Obsidian URLs

**Control Manager (2 files)**:
- `tools/control-manager/src/cli.ts` - Complete replacement of all console statements
- `tools/control-manager/src/docker-manager.ts` - Complete replacement of all console statements

#### Session 3 (2 files):
**Final Production Code Files**:
- `apps/cli/src/commands/help-command.ts` - console.log â†’ logger.info()
- `packages/table-view/src/TableView.tsx` - console.error â†’ logger.error()

**Note**: Console statements in test utilities were intentionally kept for debugging purposes.

**Pattern Applied**:
```typescript
// Before:
console.log('message');
console.error('error');

// After:
import { Loggers } from '@mmt/logger';
const logger = Loggers.web();  // or .control(), .api(), etc.
logger.info('message');
logger.error('error');
```

## Remaining Work - Recommended Order ðŸ”„

### NEXT: 1. Large Files Refactoring (Issue #228)
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Why Second**: Will catch issues before runtime, makes refactoring safer
**From Code Review**: Some any types, incomplete type coverage

**Tasks**:
- Remove any types from production code
- Add proper type exports from packages
- Implement type coverage reporting
- Add type generation tests

### Large Files Refactoring (Issue #228) - REMAINING

**Estimated Effort**: 9-13 hours total (per Issue #228)
**Why Last**: Highest risk, needs most care, benefits from better error handling and types

**Files to refactor** (in recommended order from Issue #228):
1. **TableView.tsx** (675 lines) - Least risky, React component (~2-3 hours)
2. **documents.ts** (669 lines) - Medium risk, API routes (~3-4 hours)
3. **document-store.ts** (707 lines) - Highest risk, state management (~4-6 hours)

**See Issue #228 for detailed refactoring strategies**

## Quick Start for Next Session

```bash
# Start fresh from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create branch for error handling work
git checkout -b fix/error-handling-standardization

# Key files to focus on:
# 1. Create error classes in packages/entities/src/errors.ts
# 2. Update API error handling in apps/api-server/src/middleware/error.ts
# 3. Add error boundary to apps/web/src/App.tsx
```


## Testing After Changes

```bash
# Run tests for affected packages
pnpm test

# Check specific package (examples)
pnpm --filter @mmt/entities test
pnpm --filter @mmt/api-server test
pnpm --filter @mmt/web test

# Verify UI still works
node tools/check-browser-health.js

# Run linting and type checking
pnpm lint
pnpm type-check
```

3. Large Files in #228 (9-13 hrs) â†’ With safety measures in place

**Total Estimated Time Remaining**: 9-13 hours

## Notes for Next Developer

### What's Working Well
- All production code console statements have been replaced with Logger
- Logger module is properly configured and working throughout the codebase
- Test mocking has been completely removed - all tests use real implementations
- Large file refactoring pattern established - extract logical components to separate classes
- FilterEvaluator successfully extracted and reused between PipelineExecutor and ScriptRunner

### Watch Out For
- Some console.logs in test files might be intentional for debugging
- When refactoring large files, preserve all existing functionality
- Run tests after each change to ensure nothing breaks
- The app should be tested with `node tools/check-browser-health.js` after UI changes

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **FIRST**: Error Handling Standardization (2-3 hrs) - Create foundation for safer refactoring
2. **SECOND**: Type Safety Improvements (2-3 hrs) - Better compile-time safety
