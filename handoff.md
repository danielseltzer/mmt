# MMT Handoff Document

## Current Status (2025-08-07 - Updated)

### üöÄ V3 Implementation In Progress

**COMPLETED**: 
- ‚úÖ Issue #156: Multi-vault configuration schema implemented and merged (PR #188)
- ‚úÖ All config files migrated to new format
- ‚úÖ API server updated to use first vault as default
- ‚úÖ Issue #186 created for vault context architecture

**IN PROGRESS**:
- üîÑ Issue #186: Establishing vault context as first-class domain concept (branch: `feat/186-vault-context-architecture`)

### üéØ MAJOR UPDATE: V3 Planning Complete - Ready for Implementation

A comprehensive planning session has been completed for **MMT V3**, transforming MMT from a single-vault tool into an **IDE-like multi-document-set environment**. All planning documents, GitHub milestones, and issues have been created.

### Key Documents Created
- **[/docs/planning/PRD-v3.md](docs/planning/PRD-v3.md)** - Complete V3 Product Requirements Document
- **[/ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** - Detailed 9-week implementation roadmap with 6 phases

### GitHub Structure Created
- **6 New Milestones** (Milestones 7-12) with due dates
- **30 New Issues** (#156-185) across all phases
- **5 New Labels**: `v3-core`, `v3-ui`, `v3-api`, `v3-migration`, `v3-docs`

## V3 Vision Summary

### Core Concept
MMT V3 introduces **multiple document sets in tabs**, where each tab represents:
- A vault (data source)
- A workflow (sequence of executed pipelines)
- Independent state (filters, selections, history)

### Key Innovations
1. **Tab-based Interface**: Work with multiple vaults simultaneously
2. **Workflows**: Pipelines become immutable history entries after execution
3. **Manual Selection**: Checkboxes for excluding specific documents
4. **Set Operations**: Union, intersection, difference across tabs
5. **IDE Features**: Status bar, output panel, document preview

### Terminology Established
- **Transform**: Atomic action (rename, move, etc.)
- **Pipeline**: Complete unit (filters + transforms + output)
- **Workflow**: Sequence of pipelines in a tab (saveable/reloadable)

## Implementation Phases (Start Immediately)

### üìç Phase 1: Multi-Vault Foundation (Weeks 1-2) - IN PROGRESS
**Issues #156-160 in Milestone 7**

Priority order:
1. **#156**: ‚úÖ DONE - Update configuration schema for multiple vaults (PR #188 merged)
2. **#186**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS - Establish vault context as first-class domain concept
3. **#159**: ‚è≥ NEXT - Update API endpoints to accept vault identifier  
4. **#158**: ‚è≥ Create per-tab state management
5. **#157**: ‚è≥ Implement tab bar component
6. **#160**: ‚è≥ Create vault selector component

**Current Work - Issue #186**:
```typescript
// Designing VaultContext to flow through entire system
interface VaultContext {
  vaultId: string;  // Unique vault identifier
  vault: VaultConfig;  // Full vault configuration
  // Context will expand as requirements emerge
}
```

**Next Steps After #186**:
```bash
# Continue with API vault awareness
git checkout -b feat/159-vault-aware-endpoints
# Update all API endpoints to use VaultContext
# See issue #159 for detailed requirements
```

### Upcoming Phases
- **Phase 2**: Workflow System (#161-165)
- **Phase 3**: Selection & Exclusion (#166-170)
- **Phase 4**: IDE Features (#171-175)
- **Phase 5**: Similarity Search UI (#176-180)
- **Phase 6**: V3 Polish (#181-185)

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Multi-Vault Configuration Schema (‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED)
```yaml
# New V3 format - NOW LIVE IN CODEBASE
vaults:
  - name: "Personal"
    path: "/absolute/path/to/personal"
    indexPath: "/absolute/path/to/personal-index"
    fileWatching:  # Optional
      enabled: true
      debounceMs: 200
  - name: "Work"
    path: "/absolute/path/to/work"
    indexPath: "/absolute/path/to/work-index"
```

### Vault Context Pattern (üîÑ DESIGNING)
```typescript
// Issue #186 - Establishing proper context flow
// Key insight: Don't just pass vault IDs around
// Create a proper context that will be understood by future AI agents

// Current "first vault as default" pattern (temporary):
const defaultVault = config.vaults[0];

// Target pattern (after #186):
const context = createVaultContext(vaultId);
// Context flows through all operations
await indexer.query(query, context);
await operation.execute(document, context);
```

### State Management Architecture
Each tab needs independent state:
```typescript
interface TabState {
  id: string;
  vaultName: string;
  documents: Document[];
  workflow: Pipeline[]; // History of executed pipelines
  currentPipeline: Pipeline | null;
  selection: Set<string>;
}
```

### Workflow YAML Format (Phase 2)
```yaml
name: "Monthly Review"
vault: "personal-vault"
pipelines:
  - id: "p1"
    executed: "2024-01-15T10:32:00Z"
    filters: [...]
    transforms: [...]
    results: { matched: 47, modified: 47 }
```

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Selection ‚Üí Filter Pattern**: Manual selections become declarative exclusion filters
2. **Pipeline History**: Executed pipelines become read-only history entries
3. **Tab State**: Each tab has completely independent state
4. **Set Operations**: Create new tabs with results
5. **Similarity Search**: Initially separate panel, later integrated as filter type

## Current Codebase State

### What's Working
- ‚úÖ Single vault with full pipeline functionality
- ‚úÖ Similarity search backend (API complete)
- ‚úÖ Document filtering and operations
- ‚úÖ Pipeline preview mode

### What Needs V3 Updates
- ‚ùå No multi-vault support (hardcoded single vault)
- ‚ùå No tab interface
- ‚ùå No workflow history
- ‚ùå No manual selection/exclusion
- ‚ùå No similarity search UI

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development
pnpm dev

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Type checking
pnpm type-check
```

## Architecture Notes for Implementation

### Frontend Structure
- **Current**: Single Zustand store for one document set
- **V3 Need**: Refactor to support multiple document sets
- **Location**: `apps/web/src/stores/document-store.ts`

### API Changes Needed
- Add `vaultId` parameter to all document endpoints
- New endpoint: `GET /api/vaults` to list configured vaults
- Update indexer to handle multiple vault indexes

### Component Updates
- **New**: TabBar component (use Radix UI tabs)
- **Update**: QueryBar to be tab-aware
- **Update**: DocumentTable to show selection checkboxes
- **New**: StatusBar component at bottom
- **New**: OutputPanel for operation results

## Testing Strategy

- Write tests for multi-vault configuration first
- Test tab state isolation
- Ensure no regressions in existing functionality
- Performance test with multiple tabs open

## Next Session Recommendations

1. **Continue Issue #186** - Complete vault context architecture
   - Design the VaultContext interface
   - Create context module in entities package
   - Update API server to use context
   - Update indexer and services
   
2. **Then #159** - API vault support (builds on context)
3. **Then #158** - State management refactor (critical path)
4. **Visual comes last** - Tab bar UI after state works

## Key Decisions from Previous Session

1. **No backward compatibility** - I am the only user
2. **First vault as default** - Temporary pattern to avoid massive refactoring
3. **Vault context is critical** - Must be a first-class domain concept, not just ID passing
4. **Let structure emerge** - Don't over-design context with tab/user fields yet

## Performance Targets
- Tab switching: < 100ms
- Filter application: < 500ms for 10k documents
- Pipeline execution: < 5s for 500 documents
- Memory per tab: < 50MB for 1000 documents

## Questions Resolved in Planning
- ‚úÖ Tabs, not split panes (for MVP)
- ‚úÖ Dynamic document sets (not frozen)
- ‚úÖ Pipelines become history after execution
- ‚úÖ Selections generate exclusion filters
- ‚úÖ Set operations create new tabs
- ‚úÖ Similarity search as separate panel initially
