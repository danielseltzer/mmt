# Handoff Summary - shadcn/ui Integration Complete

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Issue #111 - UI Foundation with shadcn/ui

Successfully integrated shadcn/ui components into the MMT web app, replacing basic CSS with a professional component library.

#### Technical Changes Made:

1. **Fixed React Version Conflicts**
   - Updated table-view package to use React 19.1.0 (matching web app)
   - Fixed peerDependencies to require React ^19.0.0

2. **Installed shadcn/ui Dependencies**
   - Tailwind CSS 4.1.11 with @tailwindcss/postcss
   - Radix UI components (@radix-ui/react-slot, @radix-ui/react-separator)
   - Utility libraries (class-variance-authority, clsx, tailwind-merge)
   - Lucide React for icons

3. **Created UI Components**
   - Button, Input, Card, Table, Separator, Alert components
   - All using shadcn/ui patterns with Tailwind classes
   - Slate color scheme with green accent

4. **Updated Application UI**
   - App.jsx: Card-based layout with professional styling
   - QueryBar.jsx: shadcn/ui Input with search icon
   - DocumentTable.jsx: Loading states with spinner, error alerts

5. **Fixed Build Issues**
   - Updated table-view tsconfig.json to match other packages
   - Fixed TypeScript errors in scripting package (AdvancedScriptOperation types)
   - All packages now build successfully

## Current Status

### ✅ Working
- Clean install completes
- All packages build successfully
- Web app lints without errors
- UI displays with professional shadcn/ui styling
- 5 out of 6 tests pass

### ⚠️ One Failing Test
```
FAIL src/tests/ui-components.test.jsx > shadcn/ui Integration > renders DocumentTable with shadcn/ui components
```
- Test expects role="region" but Card component doesn't have this role
- Need to update test to check for Card's actual rendered output

### ❌ Lint Issues (Not Critical)
- file-relocator package has 25 lint errors
- Other packages may have lint issues
- Web app itself has NO lint errors

## Next Steps

1. **Fix the failing test** in `src/tests/ui-components.test.jsx`
   - Change from looking for `role="region"` to checking for Card's class or content

2. **Complete verification**
   - Run full clean/install/build/lint/test cycle
   - Ensure everything passes

3. **Create PR** for Issue #111
   - Commit all changes to feat/111-shadcn-ui-integration branch
   - Push to GitHub
   - Create PR with description of changes

## Quick Commands

```bash
# To verify everything works:
cd /Users/danielseltzer/code/mmt
pnpm clean
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm lint  # Will fail on file-relocator, but web app is clean
pnpm test  # One test needs fixing

# To run just web app:
cd apps/web
pnpm dev

# Current branch:
git branch  # Should show: feat/111-shadcn-ui-integration
```

## Files Changed

Key files modified:
- `/apps/web/src/App.jsx` - Main layout with Card
- `/apps/web/src/components/QueryBar.jsx` - Search input
- `/apps/web/src/components/DocumentTable.jsx` - Table wrapper
- `/apps/web/src/globals.css` - Tailwind + shadcn/ui styles

- `/packages/table-view/package.json` - React 19 upgrade
- `/packages/entities/src/scripting-advanced.schema.ts` - Fixed types
