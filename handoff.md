# MMT Handoff Document

## Current Status (2025-08-11 - Latest Update)

### 🚀 V3 Implementation In Progress

**COMPLETED**: 
- ✅ Issue #156: Multi-vault configuration schema (PR #188 merged)
- ✅ Issue #186: Vault context architecture (PR #192 merged)
  - Created `@mmt/vault` package with VaultRegistry singleton
  - Documented in ADR-006: Vault as Container Architecture
- ✅ Issue #189: Vault-aware API routes (PR #193 merged)
  - All routes now use `/api/vaults/:vaultId/...` pattern
  - Fixed circular dependency (FileWatcher → filesystem-access)
  - Added vault validation middleware

**IN PROGRESS - Issue #195: Add test coverage for vault package**
- 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY** - Must complete before continuing with #190
- ✅ Analyzed vault package architecture - well-designed factory pattern:
  - `Vault` class: Manages single file collection from one directory
  - `VaultProvider` class: Factory that creates/manages multiple Vault instances  
  - `VaultRegistry` class: Singleton for app-wide vault management
- ✅ Created comprehensive test plan: `/docs/planning/vault-test-plan-issue-195.md`
- 📋 **NEXT STEPS** (in order):
  1. Add JSDoc documentation to vault classes for clarity
  2. Create test utilities following NO MOCKS rule (real files in temp dirs)
  3. Implement vault.test.ts - core Vault class tests
  4. Implement vault-provider.test.ts - factory pattern tests
  5. Implement registry.test.ts - singleton and multi-vault tests
  6. Implement integration.test.ts - real indexer integration
  7. Ensure >90% test coverage before marking complete

**UPCOMING PRIORITIES**:
- 📋 Issue #194: Remove backward compatibility code
- 📋 Issue #190: Initialize vaults at application startup (blocked by #195)
- 📋 Issue #191: Add vault selector to web UI

## 🎯 Critical Context for Issue #195

### NO MOCKS Rule - ABSOLUTE
The project has a **ZERO TOLERANCE** policy for mocks, stubs, or test doubles:
- ✅ Use real markdown files in OS temp directories
- ✅ Real file operations with Node.js `fs/promises`
- ✅ Proper cleanup in afterEach hooks
- ❌ NO mocks, stubs, or test doubles of any kind
- ❌ NO in-memory file system simulations

See `/docs/building/testing-strategy.md` for full details.

### Vault Package Architecture (No Changes Needed)
After analysis, the architecture is well-designed:
- **Naming is correct** - Don't rename `Vault` or `VaultProvider`
- **Pattern is standard** - Factory pattern with provider
- **Just needs documentation** - Add JSDoc comments to clarify relationships

### Test Requirements from User
1. **Real markdown files** in temp directories for all tests
2. **Integration tests** with real indexer package
3. **Registry tests** for multi-vault initialization and singleton behavior
4. **Target 100% coverage** (not critical, but aim high)
5. **No performance tests** - user will test with 6000-doc production vault

## 📝 Next Session Instructions

### Start on Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feat/195-vault-test-coverage
```

### Implementation Order
1. **First**: Add JSDoc documentation to vault classes
   ```bash
   # Edit these files to add documentation:
   packages/vault/src/vault.ts
   packages/vault/src/vault-provider.ts
   packages/vault/src/registry.ts
   ```

2. **Second**: Create test structure
   ```bash
   mkdir -p packages/vault/src/__tests__/fixtures
   # Create test files as outlined in test plan
   ```

3. **Third**: Implement tests following the plan in `/docs/planning/vault-test-plan-issue-195.md`

### Key Files to Reference
- **Test Plan**: `/docs/planning/vault-test-plan-issue-195.md` - Complete test implementation guide
- **NO MOCKS Policy**: `/docs/building/testing-strategy.md` - Critical testing rules
- **Vault Package**: `/packages/vault/src/` - Code to test
- **Example Config**: `/dev-config.yaml` - Multi-vault configuration example

### Test Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Add JSDoc documentation to all vault classes
- [ ] Create TestVaultFactory utility class
- [ ] Write vault.test.ts with real file operations
- [ ] Write vault-provider.test.ts for factory tests
- [ ] Write registry.test.ts for singleton tests
- [ ] Write integration.test.ts with real indexer
- [ ] Verify >90% test coverage
- [ ] Run full test suite: `pnpm --filter @mmt/vault test`
- [ ] Create PR for review

## Key Decisions from This Session

1. **Vault architecture is sound** - No refactoring needed, just documentation
2. **Test plan created** - Comprehensive coverage of all vault functionality
3. **NO MOCKS understood** - All tests must use real files in temp directories
4. **Priority confirmed** - Must complete tests before continuing with #190

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run vault package tests
pnpm --filter @mmt/vault test

# Run with coverage
pnpm --filter @mmt/vault test:coverage

# Run specific test file
pnpm --filter @mmt/vault test vault.test.ts

# Run all tests across monorepo
pnpm test
```

## Important Notes

### What NOT to Do
- ❌ Don't rename Vault or VaultProvider classes
- ❌ Don't use any mocks, stubs, or test doubles
- ❌ Don't skip test coverage - #190 is blocked until this is done
- ❌ Don't create in-memory file system abstractions

### What TO Do
- ✅ Use real markdown files in OS temp directories
- ✅ Follow the test plan exactly as documented
- ✅ Add clear JSDoc comments to improve understanding
- ✅ Test multi-vault scenarios thoroughly
- ✅ Ensure proper resource cleanup in all tests
