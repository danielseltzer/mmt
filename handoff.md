# Handoff Document - MMT Project Status

## Last Updated: 2024-12-22 (Session 4)

## Current Status: V3 TAB FEATURE COMPLETE

### Session Summary
- **Major Achievement**: Implemented V3 multi-vault tab interface (Issues #157, #158)
- Fixed critical build blockers (missing utility files)
- Tested and verified multi-vault functionality
- Note: Vault-aware API endpoints were already implemented (Issue #189 in earlier commit)

## Recently Completed Work

### V3 Multi-Vault Tab Interface (Issues #157, #158) âœ… 
- **TabBar Component**: Smart tab management that auto-hides for single vault
- **Per-Tab State**: Independent search, filters, and documents per tab
- **localStorage Persistence**: Tabs survive page refresh
- **Test Configuration**: `multi-vault-test-config.yaml` for development
- **Utility Files**: Created missing filter-utils.js and template-utils.js

### Qdrant Similarity Search (PRs #211, #212) âœ…
- **Fully functional** similarity search with Qdrant vector database
- **Visual UI** with search mode toggle and similarity scoring
- **Bug fixes** resolved (indexing regression, text search filtering)
- **Performance** is excellent (sub-second searches, 5990/6002 docs indexed)

### Issues Closed This Session
- **#157**: Implement tab bar component - COMPLETED
- **#158**: Create per-tab state management - COMPLETED  
- **#206**: Similarity indexing regression - FIXED in PR #211
- **#207**: Text search filtering bug - FIXED 
- **#209**: Error logging improvements - IMPLEMENTED

## Technical Context for Next Session

### Running the System
```bash
# Test multi-vault tabs
./bin/mmt start --config multi-vault-test-config.yaml

# Or with Qdrant similarity search
./bin/mmt start --config config/personal-vault-qdrant.yaml

# Ensure Docker is running Qdrant (for similarity)
docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant

# Ensure Ollama is running for embeddings (for similarity)
ollama serve
```

### Key Configuration Files
- `multi-vault-test-config.yaml` - Multi-vault test configuration (NEW)
- `config/personal-vault-qdrant.yaml` - Working Qdrant config
- `dev-config.yaml` - Development configuration
- `personal-vault-config.yaml` - Alternative personal config

### Recent Code Changes
- **NEW**: TabBar component in `/apps/web/src/components/TabBar.tsx`
- **NEW**: Per-tab state in `/apps/web/src/stores/document-store.ts`
- **NEW**: Utility files in `/apps/web/src/utils/`
- Similarity search UI components in `/apps/web/src/components/`
- Qdrant provider in `/packages/similarity-provider-qdrant/`
- Vault-aware API routes in `/apps/api-server/src/routes/`

## Recommended Next Session Plan

### Recommended Next Actions
1. **Documentation** (#213) - Document both Qdrant and Tab features - 1 hour
2. **Bug Fix** (#208) - Fix document paths showing as "/" - 30 min
3. **Testing** - Add tests for tab functionality - 1 hour
4. **Performance** - Optimize tab switching and state persistence - 1 hour

## Notes for Next Session

### What's Working Well
- **V3 Tab Interface is COMPLETE and functional**
- Multi-vault support is fully operational
- Qdrant similarity search is stable and performant
- Text search is functioning correctly
- Vault-aware API endpoints are working

## Session Handoff Complete
The project has reached a major milestone with the V3 multi-vault tab interface now fully implemented! Both the Qdrant similarity search and tab features are working excellently. The foundation for the V3 vision is in place. The next session should focus on documentation (#213) and polishing the user experience.
