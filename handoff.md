# Handoff Summary

## Current State

Successfully migrated MMT from Electron to React web app architecture (PR #103). The application now runs as:
- REST API server (Express + TypeScript) on port 3001
- React web app (Vite + React 19) on port 5173
- Control manager tool orchestrates both services

### What Works
- Document indexing and display
- Search functionality with debouncing
- Table view with sorting and selection
- Playwright E2E tests confirm no console errors
- Clean TypeScript build (except scripting package)

### Known Issues
- Scripting package has Arquero type errors (pre-existing)
- One file-watching test fails in indexer (pre-existing)

## Priority Plan

### P0 - Critical Issues to Resolve First
1. **#92** - Fix tRPC version mismatch blocking builds
   - May be obsolete after Electron removal - needs verification
   
2. **#93** - E2E tests hang when launching Electron with Playwright
   - Likely obsolete after migration - should close if confirmed
   
3. **#96** - Fix lint and test errors across packages
   - Still relevant - need clean builds for stability

4. **#16** - Implement State Management
   - Partially complete (Zustand in web app)
   - May need to verify/close

5. **#13** - Implement Table View Component
   - Complete - should close

### P1 - Core Features
1. **#20** - Performance Optimization
   - Important for 5000+ file handling
   
2. **#31** - Advanced Scripting Features
3. **#30** - Script Builder UI Component
4. **#18** - Create Reports Package
5. **#14** - Build View Persistence Package

### P2 - Enhancements
1. **#86** - Fix flaky file watcher test
2. **#88** - Fix remaining ESLint errors
3. **#89-91** - Table view component fixes
4. **#22** - Add Similarity Features
5. **#21** - Create QM Provider Package
6. **#12** - Create Document Previews Package

## Next Steps

1. **Verify and Close Obsolete Issues**
   - Check if #92, #93 still apply post-migration
   - Close #13 (table view complete)
   - Update #16 if state management sufficient

2. **Fix Build/Test Issues**
   - Resolve #96 lint/test errors
   - Fix scripting package Arquero types
   - Fix flaky file watcher test

3. **Implement Core Features**
   - Script Builder UI (#30)
   - Performance optimization for large vaults (#20)
   - View persistence (#14)

## How to Run

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev                # Start both API and web servers
# OR separately:
pnpm run dev:api       # API server only
pnpm run dev:web       # Web server only

# Testing
pnpm test              # Run unit tests
# For E2E tests, first start servers, then:
npx playwright test tests/e2e/web/simple-app-test.spec.ts --config=playwright-simple.config.ts

# Build
pnpm clean && pnpm install && pnpm build
```

## Key Files Changed
- `/apps/api-server/*` - New REST API
- `/apps/web/*` - New React web app
- `/tools/control-manager/*` - Service orchestration
- `tsconfig.base.json` - moduleResolution changed to "node"
- All config files now require `apiPort` and `webPort`
