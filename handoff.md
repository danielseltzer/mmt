## Current Status

### Completed Work
- Fixed document loading issue that was causing app to hang
- Fixed tab and status bar to show full document counts instead of 500
- Added visual highlighting to active tab (thicker border, primary color)
- Removed "Active: Work" text from status bar
- Fixed similarity search to handle API response format
- Fixed double-click to open preview
- Enhanced preview modal with vault info and action buttons
- Created operation tabs UI (Search, Filter, Transform, Output)
- Updated browser health check to detect loading states

### Test Status
- Replaced test file that used mocks with compliant version
- Fixed filter conversion tests
- Fixed table-view tests to comply with NO MOCKS policy

### Current Blocking Issue
The commit is blocked by compliance violations:
- **NO BACKWARD COMPAT**: 24 violations (mostly variable names like "oldPath", comments with "legacy")
- **FILESYSTEM ACCESS**: 9 violations (direct fs usage outside filesystem-access package)
- **NO HARDCODED URLS**: 3 violations (localhost URLs hardcoded)
- **NO ESLINT DISABLE**: 5 violations (in the compliance checker itself)

### Outstanding Tasks I'm Aware Of
1. **GitHub Issue #262**: Filter, Transform, and Output panels only show placeholder content - need to restore full implementations from git history
2. **Compliance violations**: Need to be fixed before commit can proceed
3. **PR needs updating**: Changes haven't been committed yet due to compliance blocks

### What's Not Working
- Cannot commit due to compliance violations
- Filter/Transform/Output tabs don't have their detailed panels (only placeholders)
