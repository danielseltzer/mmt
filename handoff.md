# MMT Handoff Document

## Current Status (2025-07-25)

### Recently Completed Work

1. **GUI Pipeline Builder Foundation (#127)** âœ…
   - Created horizontal collapsible panels (Select/Transform/Output)
   - Panels expand/collapse with smooth transitions
   - Only one panel open at a time
   - Integrated search bar on same horizontal line
   - Filter summaries display when panels are collapsed

2. **Simplified Control System** âœ…
   - Created `./bin/mmt` as single executable entry point
   - Removed unnecessary api-only/web-only options
   - Fixed timeout issues (increased to 60s, simplified checks)
   - Updated README with clear running instructions
   - `pnpm dev` now shows helpful error directing to real command

3. **Config Management Improvements** âœ…
   - Moved yaml and zod to root-level dependencies
   - Removed duplicate dependencies from individual packages
   - Created config store with Zod validation for web app
   - Web app loads config at startup before rendering

### Current Issue Being Worked On

**Hardcoded URLs (#132)** - IN PROGRESS ðŸ”§
- Problem: Web app can't connect to API due to hardcoded URL mismatch
- Attempted solution: 
  - Created `/config` endpoint in Vite to serve API URL
  - Using environment variable `MMT_CONFIG_PATH` to pass config location
  - Web app fetches config on startup
- Current status: `/config` endpoint returns 500 error, needs debugging

### Working Branch
`feat/127-gui-pipeline-builder` - Contains all recent work

## Priority Work Queue

### 1. **Fix Config Loading Issue** - IMMEDIATE ðŸ”¥
The web app shows "Configuration Error" because the `/config` endpoint isn't working properly. Need to:
- Debug why Vite middleware isn't serving config correctly
- Ensure `MMT_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable is properly passed
- Test that web app can fetch from `/config` and connect to API

### 2. **Complete GUI Pipeline Builder (#127)** - HIGH PRIORITY
Once config is working:
- Implement TRANSFORM panel with operation builder UI
- Implement OUTPUT panel with format configuration
- Add Execute button that sends pipeline to API
- Add loading states and error handling

### 3. **Create New Issue for Config Standardization** - HIGH PRIORITY
The current approach of passing config paths is inconsistent:
- API server reads config directly
- Web server needs config passed via environment variable
- Consider creating a shared config service or better pattern

### 4. **Fix Integration Test Failures (#141)** - HIGH PRIORITY
- Tests likely failing due to port/URL changes
- Update tests to work with new config system

### 5. **Implement Stop and Status Commands (#147)** - MEDIUM PRIORITY
- Add PID file tracking
- Implement graceful shutdown
- Show server status information

## Technical Context

### Current Architecture
```
MMT Control Manager (./bin/mmt)
â”œâ”€â”€ Reads config file (YAML)
â”œâ”€â”€ Starts API server
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Reads config directly
â””â”€â”€ Starts Web server (Vite)
    â””â”€â”€ Needs config via env var MMT_CONFIG_PATH
        â””â”€â”€ Serves /config endpoint for web app
```

### Key Files Changed
- `/tools/control-manager/src/control-manager.ts` - Pass MMT_CONFIG_PATH env var
- `/apps/web/vite.config.ts` - Serve /config endpoint
- `/apps/web/src/main.jsx` - Load config before rendering
- `/apps/web/src/config/` - Config store and schema
- `/apps/web/src/stores/document-store.ts` - Use config store for API URL

### Commands
```bash
# Start MMT
./bin/mmt start --config personal-vault-config.yaml

# Old way (shows error)
pnpm dev
```

## Known Issues

1. **Config Loading**: `/config` endpoint returns 500 error
2. **Hardcoded Ports**: Still some hardcoded localhost references
3. **Vitest Version Mismatch**: Peer dependency warnings throughout

## Next Session Starting Point

1. Debug the `/config` endpoint:
   - Add console.log to see if MMT_CONFIG_PATH is set
   - Check if file path is absolute vs relative
   - Verify YAML parsing works

2. Once working, verify:
   - Web app loads config
   - Web app connects to API
   - Documents display correctly

3. Then continue with TRANSFORM panel implementation
