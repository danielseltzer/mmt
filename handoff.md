# Handoff Document - MMT Project Status

## Last Updated: 2025-08-23

## Current Status: ALL UI IMPROVEMENTS & CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETE âœ…

### Session Summary
- **Session Start**: Recovered from crash, found uncommitted V3 tab work already implemented
- **Major Fixes Completed**:
  - âœ… Similarity search graceful degradation (PR #214)
  - âœ… UI improvements - 3 enhancements (PR #216, Issue #215)
  - âœ… Open in Obsidian context menu fix (PR #218, Issue #217)
- **Testing Infrastructure Added**:
  - Browser health check tool
  - Obsidian URL validation test (TDD approach)
  - UI improvements test suite
- **Result**: System fully stable, all recent issues resolved

## Recently Completed Work (This Session)

### UI Improvements (Issue #215, PR #216) âœ…
1. **Open in Obsidian**: Added as first context menu item
2. **Panel Auto-Close**: Sub-panels close when clicking search box or switching modes
3. **Path Display Fix**: Shows "/" for root files, removes "Personal-sync" prefix

### Open in Obsidian Fix (Issue #217, PR #218) âœ…
- **Problem**: Always opened previously selected document, not the right-clicked one
- **Solution**: Track right-clicked row in context menu state
- **Testing**: Created Playwright test using TDD - confirmed bug, then validated fix
- **Result**: 100% test pass rate, correct document opens every time

### Similarity Search Graceful Degradation (PR #214) âœ…
- **Problem**: Infinite loop when similarity not configured
- **Solution**: Detect availability, auto-switch to text search, disable UI controls
- **Testing**: Browser health check tool created to verify page loads without errors

### Previously Completed (Found During Recovery)
- **V3 Multi-Vault Tabs**: Already implemented but uncommitted
- **Vault-Aware API**: Routes working at `/api/vaults/:vaultId/...`
- **Per-Tab State**: Independent state management with localStorage

## Priority Work Items for Next Session

### ðŸ¥‡ Priority 1: Documentation (Quick Win)
**Issue #213: Document Qdrant Similarity Search AND Tab Feature**
- Create user documentation for the completed Qdrant feature
- Document the new multi-vault tab interface
- Include configuration examples for multi-vault setup
- Document search modes and UI features
- Add troubleshooting guide
- **Estimated effort**: 1-2 hours

### ðŸ¥ˆ Priority 2: Continue V3 Features
The tab foundation is complete. Next V3 priorities from the roadmap:

**Performance & UX Improvements**
- ~~Issue #208: Fix document paths showing as "/"~~ **FIXED THIS SESSION**
- Optimize tab switching performance
- Add keyboard shortcuts for tab navigation
- Make Obsidian vault name dynamic (currently hardcoded as "Personal-sync")

### ðŸ¥‰ Priority 3: Test Coverage (Lower Priority)
**Issue #204: Test Case for "Too Deep Objects" Error**
- Create reproducible test case for Orama indexing error
- Identify and capture problematic file as test fixture
- **Estimated effort**: 1-2 hours

**Issue #203: Integration Test for Partial Indexing**
- Test similarity search with partially indexed documents
- Verify UI handles connection failures gracefully
- **Estimated effort**: 1-2 hours

## Technical Context for Next Session

### Running the System
```bash
# Test multi-vault tabs (CURRENTLY RUNNING as bash_17)
./bin/mmt start --config multi-vault-test-config.yaml

# Or with Qdrant similarity search
./bin/mmt start --config config/personal-vault-qdrant.yaml

# Ensure Docker is running Qdrant (for similarity - optional)
docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant

# Ensure Ollama is running for embeddings (for similarity - optional)
ollama serve

# Run tests
node tools/check-browser-health.js      # Verify UI loads
node tools/test-obsidian-urls.js        # Test Obsidian URLs
node tools/test-ui-improvements.js      # Test UI features
```

### Key Configuration Files
- `multi-vault-test-config.yaml` - Multi-vault test configuration (NEW)
- `config/personal-vault-qdrant.yaml` - Working Qdrant config
- `dev-config.yaml` - Development configuration

## Session Handoff Complete
The project has reached a major milestone with the V3 multi-vault tab interface now fully implemented! Both the Qdrant similarity search and tab features are working excellently. The foundation for the V3 vision is in place. The next session should focus on documentation (#213) and polishing the user experience.
