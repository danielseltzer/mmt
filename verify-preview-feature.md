# Document Preview Feature Verification

## Summary
Added a "Preview" option as the first item in the context menu when right-clicking on a table row (Issue #150).

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. **`/packages/table-view/src/TableView.tsx`**
   - Added state for preview modal: `previewModal` with `isOpen` and `documentPath`
   - Added "Preview" button as the first item in the row context menu
   - Integrated the DocumentPreviewModal component

2. **`/packages/table-view/src/DocumentPreviewModal.tsx`** (New file)
   - Created a modal component to display document previews
   - Fetches preview data from `/api/vaults/:vaultId/documents/preview/:path` endpoint
   - Displays document metadata (title, size, modified date, tags, frontmatter)
   - Shows preview of document content
   - Includes a close button (X) and responds to Escape key

### Features Implemented:
- ✅ Preview appears as the FIRST option in the context menu
- ✅ Works for single document selection (right-click on any row)
- ✅ Opens a modal showing the document preview
- ✅ Uses the existing preview API endpoint
- ✅ Displays metadata: title, size, modified date, tags, frontmatter
- ✅ Shows content preview with "... (document continues)" for long documents
- ✅ Modal can be closed with X button or Escape key

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing:
1. Start the application: `./bin/mmt start --config config/test/multi-vault-test-config.yaml`
2. Open browser to http://localhost:5173
3. Click on any vault card to view documents
4. Right-click on any table row
5. Verify "Preview" appears as the first option in the context menu
6. Click "Preview" 
7. Verify the modal opens with:
   - Document path in the header
   - Metadata section (size, modified date, tags if present)
   - Content preview section
8. Press Escape or click X to close the modal

### Automated Test:
Created test file: `/tests/e2e/preview-context-menu-simple.test.ts`

To run: `npx playwright test tests/e2e/preview-context-menu-simple.test.ts`

## API Endpoint Used
The preview feature uses the existing endpoint:
- **GET** `/api/vaults/:vaultId/documents/preview/:path`
- Returns:
  - `path`: relative path
  - `fullPath`: full file path
  - `preview`: preview text (up to 20 lines or 500 chars)
  - `metadata`: title, size, mtime, tags, frontmatter
  - `hasMore`: boolean indicating if content was truncated

## Screenshots/Demo
The feature adds a context menu with "Preview" as the first option. When clicked, it opens a modal displaying:
- Document metadata at the top
- Content preview in a scrollable area
- Clear visual indication when content is truncated

## Notes
- The preview modal is self-contained within the table-view package to avoid cross-package dependencies
- The modal uses simple CSS classes for styling (no external UI library dependencies beyond what's already in the project)
- Error handling is included for failed API requests
- Loading state is shown while fetching preview data
