# HANDOFF.md - Document Operations Implementation Status

## Overview
This document provides a quick orientation for the next agent working on the MMT (Markdown Management Toolkit) project. The primary focus has been implementing the Document Operations Package (Issue #10).

## Current Branch
- **Branch**: `feat/10-document-operations`
- **Status**: Phases 1-4 completed, ready for PR

## What's Been Completed

### Phase 1: Core Types ✅
- Defined all TypeScript interfaces in `packages/document-operations/src/types.ts`
- Created comprehensive type tests with GIVEN/WHEN/THEN documentation
- Established operation registry pattern for extensibility

### Phase 2: Move Operation ✅
- Implemented `MoveOperation` class with full validation
- Handles complex link updates when files are moved
- Supports both absolute and relative wikilinks
- Includes backup creation and dry-run mode
- 100% test coverage with real file operations (NO MOCKS)

### Phase 3: Rename Operation ✅
- Implemented `RenameOperation` class
- Auto-adds `.md` extension if missing
- Updates self-references within the document
- Updates all incoming links from other documents
- Comprehensive test suite covering edge cases

### Phase 4: Update Frontmatter Operation ✅
- Implemented `UpdateFrontmatterOperation` class
- Supports two modes: merge (default) and replace
- Can remove properties by setting them to null
- Handles complex nested structures
- Preview shows YAML before/after comparison
- Uses existing gray-matter dependency (no js-yaml needed)

## Key Architecture Decisions

### NO MOCKS Policy
- All tests use real file operations in temp directories
- Tests create actual vault structures and verify real outcomes
- This ensures our tests reflect actual system behavior

### Link Update Strategy
- When moving/renaming files, all referencing documents are updated
- Both `[[wikilinks]]` and `![[embeds]]` are handled
- Preserves link aliases: `[[old|alias]]` → `[[new|alias]]`

### Operation Context
- All operations receive a context with vault, filesystem, indexer, and options
- Operations are atomic - they either fully succeed or fail with no partial changes
- Backup creation is optional but recommended for destructive operations

## What's Next

### Phase 5: Delete Operation (Issue #10)
Next task is implementing the delete operation:
- Should move files to trash/recycle bin instead of permanent deletion
- Update all links in referencing documents to show broken link indication
- Create comprehensive tests following the established pattern

### Phase 6: Transaction Support (Issue #10)
After delete operation:
- Implement transaction wrapper for multiple operations
- Ensure all-or-nothing execution
- Support rollback on failure

### Other Pending Work
1. **Issue #29**: Add Document Operations to Scripting API
2. **Issue #45**: Create ADR for script execution model (async/sync)
3. **Issue #60**: Implement file watching with chokidar
4. **Issue #11**: Build File Relocator Package

## Test Coverage Status
Run `pnpm test-report` to generate coverage report. Current status:
- document-operations: 100% test documentation (all tests have GIVEN/WHEN/THEN)
- Other packages need GIVEN/WHEN/THEN comments added to their tests

## Important Notes

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all document operations tests
pnpm --filter @mmt/document-operations test

# Run specific test file
pnpm --filter @mmt/document-operations test update-frontmatter.test.ts

# Generate test coverage report
pnpm test-report
```

### Key Files to Review
1. `/packages/document-operations/src/types.ts` - Core interfaces
2. `/packages/document-operations/tests/test-utils.ts` - Test infrastructure (NO MOCKS)
3. `/packages/document-operations/src/operations/*.ts` - Operation implementations
4. `/CLAUDE.md` - Project-specific instructions including NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY rule

### Recent Architectural Decisions
1. **NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY**: User is the only one using the system, keep it simple
2. **Test Documentation**: All tests should have GIVEN/WHEN/THEN comments
3. **File Watching**: Will be implemented with chokidar (Issue #60)

## Git/PR Instructions
The current work is ready to be committed and a PR created. The commit message should emphasize:
- Implementation of Document Operations Package (Phases 1-4)
- Adherence to NO MOCKS testing policy
- Comprehensive link update functionality
- Test-first development approach
