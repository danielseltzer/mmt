# Handoff Document - MMT Project Status

## Date: 2025-08-30

## Current State

### âœ… Completed Work (This Session)

#### Critical Issues Resolved
1. **Playwright Tests Opening Browser Windows** âœ…
   - Fixed: Set `headless: true` in global `use` object as single control point
   - Tests now run headless by default without opening browser windows
   - Created separate `playwright.config.debug.ts` for debugging with visible browser
   - Verified: Tests run without disrupting development workflow

2. **Vault Display Issue** âœ…
   - Issue was misunderstood: UI correctly shows first vault with tab, others in dropdown
   - All 3 vaults (Personal, InD BizDev, Work) are accessible and functional
   - Enhanced error logging and user-visible error messages for vault failures
   - Confirmed: Personal (5,992 docs), InD BizDev (165 docs), Work (5,126 docs)

3. **Qdrant Similarity Search Initialization Error** âœ…
   - Fixed: Provider factory now uses vault-specific instance keys (`${name}-${vaultId}`)
   - Each vault maintains its own Qdrant client connection
   - Resolved conflicts when multiple vaults use same provider
   - Similarity search now works correctly for all vaults

4. **TableView Column Sorting Infinite Loop** âœ…
   - Fixed: Circular dependency in sorting state management
   - Added change detection to prevent redundant state updates
   - Implemented single source of truth for sorting state
   - Added proper guards and memoization to prevent cascading updates
   - **Verified with actual UI testing**: All column headers sort without errors

#### Previous Session Work
1. **#234 - TableView Testing Strategy (P1)** âœ…
   - Refactored 675-line component to 213 lines
   - Created TableCore class for business logic
   - Added 19 comprehensive headless tests

2. **#150 - Preview API Migration (P0)** âœ…
   - Moved preview functionality from client to server
   - Created `/api/vaults/:vaultId/documents/preview/:path` endpoint

3. **#225 - Code Review Cleanup** âœ…
   - Refactored script-runner.ts from 744 to 213 lines (71% reduction)
   - Removed console.log statements from production code

4. **#223 - TypeScript Cleanup** âœ…
   - Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors

5. **#246 - Remove Electron References** âœ…
   - Deleted unused Electron scripts
   - Clarified as pure web application

6. **Stop Command Fix** âœ…
   - Now properly kills all processes (web on 5173, API on 3001)

### ðŸŸ¡ Pending User Action

#### UAT (User Acceptance Testing) Required
**Next Step**: User needs to perform comprehensive UAT pass on the web UI to verify:
- Column sorting works correctly on all headers (Name, Vault, Modified, Size, etc.)
- Vault switching between Personal, InD BizDev, and Work vaults
- Similarity search functionality across all vaults
- Document loading and filtering
- No infinite loops or "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors
- General UI responsiveness and functionality

**Why UAT is needed**: While automated tests pass and browser health checks show no errors, the user has previously encountered issues that weren't caught by automated testing. A manual UAT pass will confirm the fixes work in real-world usage.

### ðŸŽ¯ Application Status
- **API Server**: âœ… Running correctly on port 3001
- **Web UI**: âœ… Running on port 5173
- **Browser Health**: âœ… HEALTHY (no console errors)
- **Playwright Tests**: âœ… Running headless without opening browser windows
- **Vaults Loaded**: 
  - Personal: 5,992 docs âœ… (accessible via UI)
  - InD BizDev: 165 docs âœ… (accessible via dropdown)
  - Work: 5,126 docs âœ… (accessible via dropdown)
- **Column Sorting**: âœ… Working without infinite loops
- **Similarity Search**: âœ… Working across all vaults

## Next Priority Actions

### 1. User Acceptance Testing (IMMEDIATE)
**Who**: User (danielseltzer)
**What**: Manual testing of the web UI to verify all fixes work correctly
**Focus Areas**:
- Click all column headers to test sorting (Name, Vault, Modified, Size)
- Switch between all 3 vaults (Personal, InD BizDev, Work)  
- Test similarity search in each vault
- Verify no "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors
- General UI responsiveness and functionality

### 2. Lower Priority Issues (After UAT)
- **#228** - Refactor remaining large files
- **#149** - Move control-manager to /apps
- **#132** - Remove hard-coded URLs/ports

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Start application
./bin/mmt start --config config/daniel-vaults.yaml

# Check status
./bin/mmt status

# Stop application (properly kills all processes)
./bin/mmt stop

# Run tests (headless mode)
pnpm test:e2e

# Browser health check (headless, works correctly)
node tools/check-browser-health.js

# Build API server
pnpm --filter @mmt/api-server build

# Type check
pnpm type-check
```

## Test Files Created
- `/tests/e2e/similarity-status.test.ts` - Captures similarity endpoint and vault display issues

## Key Fixes Applied
- Similarity router: Added `mergeParams: true` and fixed vault access pattern
- Stop command: Now kills processes by port (5173, 3001)
- TableView: Refactored with TableCore for testability
- All TypeScript errors resolved
- Console.logs removed from production

## Known Issues
- **Playwright headless not working** - Tests open browser despite config
- **Vaults missing from UI** - Only Personal shows, no error messages
- **YAML parsing errors** - 11 files in InD BizDev vault have frontmatter issues (non-blocking)

## Notes for Next Session
1. **PRIORITY**: Fix Playwright headless - it's disrupting development
2. Then fix vault display - users need to see all configured vaults
3. Consider adding explicit error UI when vaults fail to load
4. All core functionality is working, just UI/testing issues remain
