# Session 8 Summary & Next Priorities

## Completed Work ‚úÖ

### Quick Win Improvements
1. **Dead Code Removal**
   - Removed legacy `/api/similarity/status/detailed` endpoint
   - Fixed ESLint configuration issues

2. **Type Guard Consolidation** 
   - Created centralized `@mmt/entities/type-guards.ts`
   - 18 reusable type guards now available
   - Updated qdrant-provider and document-selector to use centralized guards
   - Improves type safety and reduces code duplication

3. **Analysis Document**
   - Created comprehensive CODE_REVIEW_ANALYSIS.md
   - Identified and prioritized remaining improvements
   - Strategic roadmap for code quality enhancements

## Build & Test Status üîÑ

### Build ‚úÖ
- All packages build successfully
- Type guards properly integrated
- Dependencies correctly updated

### Tests ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Config service tests failing (pre-existing issue - Logger output not captured)
- Other test suites passing
- This is not related to our changes

## Priority Work Queue

### Immediate Priority (Issue #228) - Large File Refactoring
**Time Estimate**: 9-13 hours

1. **TableView.tsx** (675 lines) - START HERE
   - Lowest risk
   - Clear extraction patterns
   - 2-3 hours

2. **documents.ts** (669 lines)  
   - Medium risk
   - Extract service classes
   - 3-4 hours

3. **document-store.ts** (707 lines)
   - Highest risk
   - Complex state management
   - 4-6 hours

### High Priority Issues

#### Bug Fixes (Milestone 17)
- #219: Fix duplicate entries in document table
- #204: Investigate 'Too deep objects' indexing error

#### Tech Debt (Milestone 18) 
- #223: Clean up TypeScript issues
- #225: Code review recommendations (IN PROGRESS)
- #228: Large file refactoring (NEXT)

#### Core V3 Features (Milestone 21)
- #224: Per-vault similarity configuration
- #176-180: Similarity search UI components
- #175: Set operation algorithms

### Medium Priority

#### Documentation (Milestone 19)
- #213: Document Qdrant similarity search
- #183: Update docs for V3

#### Testing
- #210: Add similarity search E2E tests
- #181: Comprehensive workflow testing

## Recommended Next Session Focus

### Option A: Continue Code Quality (RECOMMENDED)
Start Issue #228 with TableView.tsx refactoring
- Clear scope
- Low risk
- Good momentum from Session 8

### Option B: Bug Fixes
Address #219 (duplicate entries) and #204 (indexing error)
- User-facing improvements
- May require investigation time

### Option C: V3 Features
Work on similarity search UI (#176-180)
- High value features
- Requires design decisions

## Technical Debt Status

### Completed ‚úÖ
- NO MOCKS violations fixed
- Console.log usage eliminated
- Error handling standardized
- Type safety at 98.5%
- Type guards consolidated

### Remaining üîÑ
- 3 large files need refactoring
- ESLint configuration needs cleanup
- Test output capture issue in config service

## Git Status
- All changes pushed to main
- No PR needed (working directly on main)
- Clean working directory

## Notes for Next Session

1. If starting Issue #228:
   - Begin with TableView.tsx
   - Review existing extracted modules (tab-manager, filter-manager)
   - Write tests before refactoring
   - Use feature branch: `refactor/large-files-issue-228`

2. Build is stable - can proceed with confidence
3. Config test failures are pre-existing, not blocking
